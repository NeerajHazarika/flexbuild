# logs
- clocked in at 15:00
- tried running ptp4l and phc2sys commands in two different terminal got, error due to FAULTY status at eno0 port due, tried to fix it by trying to ignore FAULTY status config, still phc2sys synchronization not happening
- FAULTY status is due to network inconnectivity on the port, so tried to connect ethernet to router using 1G MAC0 port (eno0)
- then logged into it with ssh
- success time synchronized hardware clock with system clock, but step function of synchronization was not working, to fix we need to stop systemd-timesyncd because then phc2sys gets excusive control to the system clock and was able to perform intial large time jump
- need to ask someone for longer ethernet cable, because on resetting switch, new ip is assigned, so connecting via ssh on reset becomes hectic if i have to keep connecting the serial cable without keeping the switch on the middle of floor walkway
- tomorrow try to copy the realtime updated by systemd-timesyncd from system clock to hardware clock, then stop systemd-timesyncd and sysnchronize system clock with hardware clock using ptp4l and phc2sys
- clocked out at 20:00

# notes
- Stop the old processes:
    First, make sure the old background processes are stopped.
    sudo killall ptp4l
    sudo killall phc2sys

- To run in the background and save it in a file 
    sudo ptp4l -i eno0 -m > ptp4l.log 2>&1 &
    sudo phc2sys -s eno0 -c CLOCK_REALTIME -w -m -F 1.0 > phc2sys.log 2>&1 &

- the Linux kernel and phc2sys are very reluctant to perform large steps and will often refuse, as you saw with the "Invalid argument" error.
- The Solution: The -F Flag
The -F flag stands for "Step threshold only on start". It's designed to solve this exact problem. It gives phc2sys special permission to perform a one-time clock step only when it first starts up.

- How to stop the background process:
    pgrep ptp4l
    sudo kill 1234

- Check the phc2sys log
    tail -f phc2sys.log

- stop systemd-timesyncd commands using:
    systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd
    systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd
