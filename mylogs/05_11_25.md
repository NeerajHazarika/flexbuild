- clockedin 13 PM
- SW2 DIP switch was at default settings SW2[1:4]=1111 and SW2[5]=1 and SW2[6:8]=000
- new objective given, understand and implement time sync (PHC and Qbv (low level)) using PTP0 & 1 and char files
- is it kernel patch or main line kernel 
- understnad drivers and source code to check how level hardware can we access

# notes
- SW2 is a DIP switch, (DIP) switches to allow easy configuration of the system for the most popular board options
- RCW Fetch Location (Switches SW2[1:4]) tells the processor where to find the Reset Configuration Word (RCW). The RCW is a small block of data that configures critical hardware at the earliest stage of boot-up. It sets up things like the speed of the memory (DDR), which clock sources to use, and which peripherals are active. The processor must load this RCW before it can do anything else.
- SW2[1:4] = 1000: SDHC1: SD card: This setting tells the processor to look for the RCW on the SD card
- Reset Mode (Switch SW2[5]) how the external reset button/signal (RESET_REQ_B) behaves, default setting (1 or ON) is correct. It allows the reset button to work as expected.
- XSPI Device Mapping (Switches SW2[6:8]) advanced setting that controls how the XSPI (a very fast serial interface) connects to the different flash memory chips on the board (like the NOR and NAND flash).
