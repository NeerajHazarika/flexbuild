# notes
- clocked in 15:00
- trying to understand where i left out, need to have gps module or usb gps antenna.
- trying to understand all configs of ts2phc
- all 4 swp0-4 are connected to eno2 ethernet port 2 interface and to phc2. we cannot use different port for different clock as all the ports use a shared hardware clock.
- but the board can generate pps signal according to one of the hardware clock from the j12 header
- can take pps input from j11 header.
- consider the confusion regarding only ptp0 having external time stamping and pps support, that means we cannot do both gps and grandmaster clock timesync together as only 1 clock supports both.
- clock out at 20:05
