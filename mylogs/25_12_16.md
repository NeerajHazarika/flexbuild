- clocked in at 1 PM
- setup both nxp switch in the lab, connected them to gps antenna, to 5g core pc, tested ts2phc commands in both switch, both working properly.
- nxp switch down uses baudrate 9600 and nxp switch up uses baudrate 38400 (baudrate difference likely due to gps module).
- pps2phc in switch-down time sync converges to +/-20ns and phc2sys in switch-down time sync converges to +/-30ns

# notes
- cmake is a build system generator. It creates build files (like Makefiles) for your project.
- .. means “run CMake using the configuration files (CMakeLists.txt) in the parent directory.”
Example: If you are in build-arm64/ and your source is in ../, this tells CMake to use the source files from the parent directory.
- -D is a flag to define a variable for CMake.
ARCH=arm64 sets the variable ARCH to the value arm64.
This is used to tell CMake (and the build system) which architecture to build for.
- A toolchain is a set of tools (compiler, linker, etc.) used to build software for a specific platform or architecture.
Example: gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu is a cross-compiler toolchain for ARM64.
A toolchain file is a CMake configuration file that tells CMake which compiler and tools to use, and for which architecture.
It usually sets variables like CMAKE_C_COMPILER, CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER, and CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR.
You use it with:
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../aarch64.toolchain.cmake

cmake generates build files (like Makefiles or Ninja files) from CMakeLists.txt.
make is a build tool that reads a Makefile and actually compiles the code.
Typical workflow:
Run cmake to generate the Makefile.
Run make to build the project using that Makefile.

- Cross-compiling means building software on one architecture (e.g., x86_64 PC) to run on another (e.g., ARM64 board).
You need a cross-toolchain and often a toolchain file for this.

- A kernel module is a piece of code that can be loaded into the Linux kernel at runtime, often used for drivers or low-level features.
Building kernel modules for another architecture requires matching the target kernel version and architecture.

- CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION?
This variable tells CMake the version of the target system (often the kernel version), which helps when building kernel modules.
