- To set a static IP address on your internal swp0 interface (or whatever your physical interface is named on the switch), you typically use ip commands or edit the network interface file.
- Method 1: Temporary (Valid until reboot)
- sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev swp0
- sudo ip link set swp0 up

- Method 2: Permanent (On Debian/Ubuntu)
- sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
- Add/Edit the entry for swp0:
auto swp0
iface swp0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.100
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1  # Optional: only if this interface gives you internet access
- sudo service networking restart
# OR
sudo ifdown swp0 && sudo ifup swp0
