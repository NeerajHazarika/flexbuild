- clocked in 11:30
- 1588 trig in j11 pin2 is already on, no need to change rcw settings.
- uart need to be configured by switching the dip switches. DIP SWITCH SW3[5:6] = 10 for mikroclick module 1 and 11 for mikroclick module2
- then need to test the command from gitlab by connecting the gps module simulator.
- successfully connected all the pins to the board with simulated gps input using pps and serial
- compiled custom ts2phc tool to run at specified baudrate to synchnize hardware clock with gps input
ts2phc -m  -s nmea --ts2phc.nmea_serialport /dev/ttyS3 -c /dev/ptp1
